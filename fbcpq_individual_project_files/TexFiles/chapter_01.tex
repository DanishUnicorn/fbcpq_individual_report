\section*{Preface}
This written report has been prepared as part of the course NPLK14014U - Fruit and Berry Crop Physiology and Quality at the University of Copenhagen. The course explores the physiological and biochemical factors determining fruit development, yield, and quality in relation to fresh consumption and processing. Emphasis is placed on how genetic, environmental, and management factors influence internal and external fruit quality, including the formation of secondary metabolites and sensory attributes such as aroma.

The present project is a theoretical study on the development and composition of aroma in mango, \textit{Mangifera indica L}., The focus is on the biochemical formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their relationship to fruit ripening and sensory quality. The report integrates physiological and biochemical knowledge to describe how preharvest conditions, cultivar differences, and post-harvest handling affect aroma expression and the perception of fruit quality.

The assignment was carried out by Lucas Daniel Paz Zuleta (TZS159), MSc student at the University of Copenhagen, as an individual written report fulfilling the course requirements for NPLK14014U - Fruit and Berry Crop Physiology and Quality.

\section*{Summary}
%This project investigates the theoretical potential of a hemp seed protein bar as a sustainable alternative to other protein bars on the market. The aim of the project was to design a nutrient-rich product with a favourable environmental profile, while addressing market demands for plant-based and health-oriented food. The nutritional composition was assessed through literature-based data on macronutrients, i.e. protein, dietary fibres, and fatty acids, with focus on the protein profile. Comparisons were made to existing market products (ROO'bar hemp protein bar), highlighting the bar's potential for high protein. Through comparing EFSA threshold to product composition, it was investigated if the product could opbtain claims as "high protein" and "high fibre". The lipid fraction showed a desirable omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, although thresholds for authorised health claims were not reached. Environmental perspectives further emphasised the advantages of hemp cultivation, including low carbon footprint, soil health benefits, and potential use of side streams. Overall, hemp seeds shows potential in developing innovative plant-based products that align with both nutritional and sustainability goals.
