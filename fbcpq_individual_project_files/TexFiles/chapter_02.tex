\section{Introduction}
Fruits are complex and heterogeneous structures that comprise  a wide variety of metabolites that serve as precursors to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as carbohydrates, fatty acids, and pigments \cite*{A03_PanoFarias2017}. The mango fruit is no exception of this complexity and have in recent years been the focus of many studies, studying the activity of volatiles in the fruit \cite*{A04_GUO2023112779}.


\subsection{Background}
Mango is a tropical fruit which belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is scientifically known as \textit{Mangifera} \cite*{A04_GUO2023112779}. It is popularly characterised as a sweet, juicy, aromatic fruit with a low fibre flesh \cite*{A05_Chin2019}. It is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, where it is of significant economic importance \cite*{A05_Chin2019}. 
The annual tropical production of mango is over 46 million tons, but is restricted by its perishable nature and susceptibility to post-harvest losses \cite*{A05_Chin2019}.
